Assignment 1 Write Up:

To compile this do "make all"

NOTE: I had to recompile Professor Moloney's program because I was getting
execl() permission errors from the one in the cs308 directory, so I added that
to my Makefile under the command "make all".

This assignment should work fully as expected.  I'm pretty sure I did everything
that was required from this assignment, and if I did not, then I am unaware of
what I am missing, and I apologize for that.  When it came to doing this assignment
I simply used my old Architecture assignment since it had the forking and pipe
already done.  I then used the notes in the assignment 1 help file and Professor
Moloney's Assign1.c file.  I did run into a few issues when doing this assignment.
The main problem was that I neede to re-compile the professor's program because
my code would give an execl() error and give some weird message about permissions.
