//Assignment 2 - write-up

To make my programs you can use make all, make sort for the sort specifically or make grep for the grep
To run my programs use ./assign2_sort cs308a2_sort_data, ./assign2_grep cs308a2_grep_data_1

NOTE: We discussed in class that we need to mention why cs308a2_grep_data_2 won't work with our grep program.
The simple answer is that the data in the file is too large for the grep command to handle.  That is because
grep does a constant storing on the i pipe and o pipe without sorting the data, where the sort does it as it
goes along the program.  The grep command eventually stores to the maximum point on the pipes and locks in place
because it is looking for the space to clear from the pipes to continue.

This assignment should be working to it's specification without any errors that I am aware of.  When it came to
doing this assignment I used some of my old code from Assignment 1 and some of the UNIX help files that are on
the cs308 website.  In the assignment itself we had options for how we did this specifically, we could write the
zip codes to stdout or write them to a file and sort it after re using that file.  I did the file path because I
found it simpler to sort from a file that had a copy of all the zip codes to search from.  The only issue I really
ran into was a spelling error on execlp, I accidentally typed excelp and overlooked that for a while.
